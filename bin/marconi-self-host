"""Bootstrap for self-hosting a Marconi node

Alternatively, to host a WSGI app with an external server, configure
kernel with the WSGI transport and export the WSGI app callable, e.g.:

    logging.config.fileConfig(logging_conf_file)
    kernel = Kernel(conf_file)

    app = kernel.transport.app

    config_file = '/etc/marconi/marconi.conf'

    logging.config.fileConfig(logging_config_file)
    kernel = marconi.Kernel(config_file)
    kernel.run()
