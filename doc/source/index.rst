=============================================
Welcome to the Zaqar developer documentation!
=============================================

Zaqar is a multi-tenant cloud messaging and notification service for web
and mobile developers.

The service features a ReST API, which developers can use to send messages
between various components of their SaaS and mobile applications, by using a
variety of communication patterns. Underlying this API is an efficient
messaging engine designed with scalability and security in mind.

Other OpenStack components can integrate with Zaqar to surface events to
end users and to communicate with guest agents that run in the
"over-cloud" layer.

.. note:: This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the Zaqar project source
   tree. Additional draft and project documentation regarding Zaqar and other components of OpenStack can
   be found on the `OpenStack Wiki`_, as well as in the user guides found on `docs.openstack.org`_.

Key features
============

Zaqar provides the following key features:

* HTTP-based messaging API
* Multi-tenant design based on Keystone project IDs
* Support for several common patterns including event broadcasting, task
  distribution, and point-to-point messaging
* Component-based architecture with support for custom backends and
  message filters
* Efficient reference implementation with an eye toward low latency and
  high throughput (dependent on backend)
* Highly-available and horizontally scalable

Project scope
=============

The Zaqar API is data-oriented. That is, it does not provision message brokers
and expose those directly to clients. Instead, the API acts as a bridge
between the client and one or more backends. A provisioning service for
message brokers—however useful—serves a somewhat different market from what
Zaqar is targeting today. With that in mind, if users are interested in a
broker provisioning service, the community should consider starting a new
project to address that need.

Design principles
=================

Zaqar, as with all OpenStack projects, is designed with the following
guidelines in mind:

* **Component-based architecture.** Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available and scalable.** Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant.** Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable.** Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards.** Be a reference implementation for a community-driven
