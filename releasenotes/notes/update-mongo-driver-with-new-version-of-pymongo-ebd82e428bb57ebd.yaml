    Upgrade one of storage drivers, mongo driver with new version of pymongo.
    Pymongo has been updated to 4.0.0, there are some changes which are not
    supported in new version:
    1. Collection.count and Cursor.count is removed.
    2. Collection.ensure_index is removed.
    3. Collection.__bool__ raises NotImplementedError.
    4. Should use Binary.from_uuid to handle the UUID object.
    Those changes need to upgrade the mongo driver's code to work well.
