"""This module implements a common Pipeline object.

The pipeline can be used to enhance the storage layer with filtering, routing,
multiplexing and the like. For example:

    >>> stages = [MessageFilter(), EncryptionFilter(), QueueController()]
    >>> pipeline = Pipeline(stages)

Every stage has to implement the method it wants to hook into. This method
will be called when the pipeline consumption gets to that point - stage
ordering matters - and will continue unless the method call returns a value
that is not None.

At least one of the stages has to implement the calling method. If none of
them do, an AttributeError exception will be raised.
